% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
Magnetically active stars with close-in planets are expected to show signs of magnetic star-planet interaction in form of a modulation of magnetic activity with the orbital phase of the planet. However, the magnitude of this interaction proves difficult to constrain.

In this study we searched the optical light curves of the young, active M1 star AU Mic for signs of flaring SPI with its innermost planet. We find that the flare occurrence rates are consistent with a uniform distribution of flares across the stellar surface with respect to stellar rotation phase. We find marginal deviation with orbital phase, but cannot make firm conclusions since the TESS light curves only cover about 5 orbital periods of AU Mic b.

\section{Introduction}

Stellar flares are known as electromagnetic explosions in the stellar coronae that are driven by the dynamics of the surface magnetic fields. As such, they are phenomena triggered intrisically by the star. Another class of flares, though phenomenologically the same, are flares triggered by magnetic star-planet interaction (SPI).

In such flares, the energy for the flare is provided by XXXX, and the event itself is triggered by the re-connection of stellar and planetary magnetic field lines. For this to occur, the planet must revolve around the star in close orbit, so that it moves within the stellar Alfven zone for at least a fraction of its orbit. When the planet is within the Alfven zone, the magnetic field and the energy transported along the field lines as particles or waves can fall back on to the star, whereas outside of it i woudl be carried away by the stellar wind. 

\textit{Do we need Prot and Porb to be different actually?}

When re-connection between star and planet occurs, the energy channelled back into the stellar atmosphere can create an activity hot spot (XXXX Halpha? Xray?) trigger a flare. The footpoint of the connecting field line is expected to move with the planetary orbit (but need not neccessarily be the sub-planetary point).

Recently, AU Mic has been shown to be a promising candidate for such magnetic SPI. \citet{kavanagh2021} predict magnetic SPI with AU Mic b to be observable in the radio regime, where re-.

Rotation period $4.862\pm 0.032$ d~\citep{martioli2021}, $4.863\pm 0.001$ d~\citep{plavchan2020}

AU Mic is a member of the $\beta$ Pic young moving group, which is $16-29$ Myr old~\citep{malo2014,binks2014,mamajek2014,bell2015,binks2016,shkolnik2017,miretroig2020}. Based on its lithium abundance, AU Mic could be a few Myr older than the average group member~\citep{malo2014}. 

%Spectral type tends to agree on M1, but effective temperature is lower in Plavchan et al. (2009)
AU Mic shows strong differential rotation (XXXX).

AU Mic has a strong surface magentic field of several hundred Gauss~\citep{klein2021}.

The TESS photometry of AU Mic shows that it is actively flaring~\citep{martioli2021}
\subsection{AU Mic b}
AU Mic b is a Neptune-sized planet ($R_p = 4.3R_{Earth}$) that was first discovered using TESS photometry~\citep{plavchan2020} with an orbital period of $8.463$ d~\citep{plavchan2020,martioli2021}.
\section{Data}

\subsection{TESS photometry}
The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite~(TESS,~\citealt{ricker2014}) is an all-sky mission that began operations in 2018, and completed its first full sky scan in April 2020. It is still observing at the time of writing, collecting nearly continuous photometric times series in the 600-1000 nm band for $\sim 27 days$ in each observing Sector. About $200\,000$ stars have been observed in 2-min cadence in the first two years of operations with about 20000 targets per Sector. Out of these, from Sector 27 on, 1000 targets were observed at even higher 20-s cadence. 
% 20000 per sector does not add up, because of stars observed in multiple sectors, the 20000 and 1000 figures can be found here: https://tess.mit.edu/observations/target-lists/

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Light curve de-trending and flare finding}
\label{sec:detrendfind}
%Transit masking
Stellar light curves are time series of flux measurements that vary due to both astrophysical and instrumental effects. Flares are only one of the phenomena that can be detected in them. To quickly identify flare signatures with the lowest false positive and false negative rates, we applied several steps to remove all but the variations caused by flares.

%Before removing these trends, we masked the transits using the information about transit mid-time, transit duration, and, if multiple transits were detected, orbital period obtained from the PSCP and TT catalogs. Except for the superactive stars AU Mic, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX we did not search for flares inside transits. %We may want to search the transits of stars that have flares in the first place.
%    - if we have reason to think that we will find flares in transits of stars that are otherwise inactive

% custom de-trending
The presented method is inspired by the iterative approach in~\citet{davenport2016} who searched the entire Kepler catalog for flares, but does not using rolling median filters except for the noise estimate in the final de-trended light curve. 

The light curves were de-trended in three steps, each of which removes variability on decreasing time scales while preserving the flare signal. Typical flare times rarely exceed are between a few minutes to a few hours, and rarely exceed 1 day in duration. Most stellar variability occurs on longer time scales, except for ultrafast rotational variability, which can be of similar time scales. 

First, we fit and subtract a third order spline function that goes through the start and end of any light curve portion that has no gaps longer than 2h, and through an averaged flux point every 30h inbetween. This step removes long term trends as well as stellar variability on time scales of 5 days and above. If the light curve portion is shorter than 5 days, this step is skipped. 

Second, we iteratively remove strong periodic signal on time scales between 2 h and 5 d from the light curve. Each iteration first masks outlier points using a padded sigma-clipping procedure. For this step, single outliers above 3.5 sigma are masked as pure outliers, and series of $n>1$ data points above 3.5 sigma are masked as flare candidates or other extended outliers and padded with rounded $\sqrt{n}$ masked points before the outliers to capture slow rise phases, and rounded $2\sqrt{n}$ after the series to capture a potential extended decay phase that flares often display. Then we calculate a Lomb-Scargle periodogram for the light curve, and performs a least-square fit with a cosine function using the dominant frequency in the periodogram as a starting point. The cosine fit is then subtracted from the light curve. We iterate five times or until the dominant peak's signal-to-noise ratio drops below 1. 

As a third step, we again apply the padded outlier clipping, and smooth any remaining variability that is not sinusoidal, first with a 6h and then with a 3h window 3rd order Savitzky-Golay~\citep{savitzky1964} filter implemented in \texttt{scipy} as \texttt{signal.savgol\_filter}.

These three steps can sometimes overfit the very edges of the light curve, leaving small exponential drops or rises in the flux that affect the quiescent flux level calculation and/or produce false positive flare detections. If the last and/or the first data point are $1\sigma$ outliers above/below standard deviation of the de-trended light cruve, we fit an exponential growth or decay functions to these fringes.

Finally we estimate the noise in the de-trended light curve using a two rolling median after padding outliers in the aforementioned way, but now above 2.5 sigma, and interpolating between them to arrive at a noise in the flare regions that is informed by the noise levels in a similar light curve portion.

The detrended light curves are then searched for flare candidates. For this, we first find an iterative median, and then apply davenport2014 method that requires 3 consecutive positive outliers 3 sigma above median for a candidate detection, and then adds subsequent data points until one of them falls below a 2 sigma above median threshold in order not to cut off detectable parts of the flare decay phase. This series of data points is then flagged as flare. For each flare, the pipeline returns the flare start and end points, duration, amplitude, and equivalent duration (ED) with uncertainty.

\textbf{Define ED and unertainty on ED here if necessary.} 

We tested our de-trending and flare-finding procedure on a range of both real and synthetic light curves that covers all typically observed variability signal patterns, and that contains flare signatures between barely exceeding the detection threshold to the largest flares we typically observe. Since we confirmed all flare candidates by eye, we can note its emprical shortcomings, and workarounds for those. 

In extremely active stars like AU Mic, that spend a significant fraction of the time in flaring state, we can recover more flares by decreasing the sigma clipping threshold in the noise estimate to 1.5 sigma instead of 2.5. 

Events like agrabrighetenings and fireflies that occur when light is reflected off of a passing particle into the detector can cause false positive detections that sometimes look similar to flares. These can be identified as occurring simultaneously in multiple light curves.

The pipeline produces many false positive events in light curves that are extracted from targets that heavily saturate the detector. In these, flares and astrophysical outbursts cannot be unambiguously distinguished from what is more likely a form of overdrive in the detectors' signal processing.

In the following we assume that we analyse $N$ light curves $S_k$ with $k\in [1,N]$ that cover observign periods that do not overlap, and each of which has the same flare detection threshold throughout the observing time of the light curve. However, our method allows that the treshold can vary from light curve to light curve. This is the case for the two Sectors in which AU Mic was observed, because Sector 1 was observed in 2 min cadence, and Sector 27 in 20 s cadence. In the latter, less energetic flares can be detected than in the former.

After having searched all $S_k$ for flares (Setion~\ref{sec:detrendfind}), we calculate the deviation from a uniform flare rate distribution with orbital and rotational phase in five steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item First, we take all $F$ flare occurrence times in AU Mic and derive their orbital or rotational phases $x_i$ with $x \in [1,F]$. 
\item Then, we sort all $x_i$ by phase in ascending order.
\item For each $x_i$, we calculate the number of flares $\hat{n_i}$ we expect to observe in the phase interval $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$, where $x_0\equiv x_F - 1$ (circular boundary condition). Assuming that flare rates are uniformly distributed, we expect to see
$$\hat{n}_i = \displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^N\dfrac{T_{obs, i, k}}{T_{obs, tot, k}} F_k$$
flares, where $T_{obs, tot, k}$ is the total observing time with TESS in each Sector, and the observing time $T_{obs,i,k}$ per phase interval is
$$T_{obs,i,k}=\displaystyle\sum_{(x>x_{i-1}\, \land \, x<x_i)} \Delta t_k,$$
where we sum all observing times in the phase interval. $\Delta t_k$ denotes the TESS observing cadence (2 min or 20 s). By treating each light curve separately we take into account their different detection thresholds, which allows us to stack flare samples from heterogeneous data. The corresponding measured number of flares in that phase interval is $n_i=1$ per definition.
\item We then calculate the cumulative frequencies of expected and measured flares as:
$$f(<i) = \dfrac{1}{F}\displaystyle\sum_{j=i}^{i}n_j= \dfrac{i}{F}$$
$$\hat{f}(<i) =  \dfrac{1}{F}\displaystyle\sum_{j=0}^{i}\hat{n}_j = \dfrac{1}{F}\displaystyle\sum_{j=0}^{i}\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^N\dfrac{T_{obs, j, k}}{T_{obs, tot, k}} F_k$$
\item Finally, we perform a two-tailed one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test to check if our observation $f(<i)$ leads us to reject the uniform distribution hypothesis represented by $\hat{f}(<i)$.
\end{enumerate}
We show both distributions for the complete sample of orbital flare phases that was passed to \texttt{scipy.stats.ks\_1samp} in Fig.~\ref{fig:cumdist}. The expected distribution is not a straight line because the different phase coverages combined with different detection thresholds of the light curves are accounted for in the derivation of the distribution (step (iii)). 

The resulting $p$-values obtained from the K-S test are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:kstests}. Because AU Mic is seen nearly equator-on, the rotational phase diagrams are consistent with a uniform distribution of flares with stellar longitude (left panel in Fig.~\ref{fig:kstests}). This is expected because XXXX (or not?).

The obsersed distribution of flares deviates by $1-2\sigma$ from a uniform distribution of flares with orbital period, which might be attributed to flaring SPI (right panel in Fig.~\ref{fig:kstests}). However, the TESS data comprise $<50$ days of observations, i.e., covering only abbout $5.7$ orbits of AU Mic b. The same magnitude of deviation would be significant at the $99\%$ or  $99.9\%$ confidence level if the observation baseline could be extended by  62.7 d ($7.4\;P_{orb}$), or 117.3 d ($13.9\;P_{orb}$), respectively. Therefore, longer monitoring of AU Mic in the optical could clarify whether SPI is present or not. In contrast to spot-induced modulation of flare occurrence rates that can only be substantiated for spots that are sufficiently long-lived, orbital modulation can use combined data from many observational campaigns. 
\begin{table}
\caption{Required observing time in days for a $99\%$ or $99.9\%$ confidence level detection of orbital phase dependent flare rates. Predictions are based on the K-S statistic obtained from the flare rates in Sectors 1, 27, and the combined sample. The required time is shorter for 20 s cadence observations than for 2 min cadence.}

\label{tab:prediction}
\end{table}
What fraction of flares stem from SPI? How many flares do we need to observe for this fraction to become significant, i.e., so that error on flare frequency << number of "SPI flares"?
\\
Even if we get a significant deviation, it is not proof that it stems from flaring SPI. However, it would allow us to more concretely model the flaring behaviour. And second, if we are correct to assume that the spot configuration in AU Mic varies across time, and the flaring regions appear and disappear on sufficiently short time scales, stacking temporally separated observations will average out effects of rotational variability. The spot pattern in Sector 1 is more stable than in Sector 27~\citep{martioli2021}
\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Were our results expected?}
No correlation with rotation period, consistent with literature~\citep{doyle2018, doyle2019}

The data cover only about 45 days of observations, that is, ~5 orbits of AU Mic b, and ~8 rotations of the star.

\citet{kavanagh2021} predict magnetic SPI with AU Mic b to be observable as ECMI originating from the star.  

\citet{fischer2019} did not find any sign of flaring SPI in TRAPPIST-1  
\section{Summary and Conclusions}
We find an upper limit to the magnitude of flaring SPI in AU Mic, which is theoretically difficult to constrain~\citep{strugarek2019}. As a next step, we will be applying the methods presented here to a larger sample of star-planet systems to increase the total number of orbits covered and to probe the effects of orbital distance, mass (ratio) etc.
