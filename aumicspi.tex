% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
Planets that move in close orbits around magnetically active stars can interact with their magnetic fields in a way that modulates the star's activity. This modulation in phase with the planet's orbit, such as enhanced X-ray activity, chromospheric spots, radio emission, or flares, are the clearest signs of magnetic star-planet interaction (SPI). However, the magnitude of this interaction is difficult to constrain in theory, and the intermittent nature of the interaction is a challenge for observers. 

AU Mic is the most actively flaring star with a recently discovered planet in a 8.6 day orbit, and a promising target for magnetic SPI observations. In this study, we used optical light curves of the young, active M1 star AU Mic obtained by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite to search for signs of flaring SPI with its innermost companion. 

We found a marginal deviation with orbital phase, and no modulation with the stellar rotation. We suggest that additional 30-120 days of optical monitoring similar to what is provided by TESS would suffice to subtantiate the tentative evidence. If the signal is true, our results can be explained by $\sim8\%$ of the 189 detected flares being triggered by the interaction with the planet.

\section{Introduction}

Flares are electromagnetic explosions in the stellar corona that are driven by the dynamics of the surface magnetic fields~\citep{benz2010}. They can be triggered intrisically by the star in isolation, but also by magnetic star-planet interaction (SPI).

In SPI flares, the event is induced by the re-connection of stellar and planetary magnetic field lines~\citep{saur2013,lanza2018,fischer2019}. For this to occur, the planet must revolve around the star in close orbit, so that it moves within the stellar Alfv\'en zone for at least a fraction of its orbit. When the planet is within the Alfv\'en zone, the magnetic field and the energy transported along the field lines as particles or waves can fall back on to the star, whereas outside of it it would be carried away by the stellar wind pressure. 


%When re-connection between star and planet occurs, the energy channelled back into the stellar atmosphere can create an activity hot spot (XXXX Halpha? Xray?) trigger a flare. The footpoint of the connecting field line is expected to move with the planetary orbit (but need not neccessarily be the sub-planetary point).

Several studies of individual systems with close-in and eccentric Hot Jupiters report excess flaring in phase with the planet or close to periastron~\citep{shkolnik2005,pillitteri2011,maggio2015}, but in light of many non-detections of excess flares in similar systems~\citep{figueira2016, fischer2019}, flaring SPI remains an elusive phenomenon. 

One interpretation is that the interaction is so weak and intermittent that the system has to be observed for many orbits of the interacting planet before SPI flares become measurable against the background of intrinsic flares~\citep{shkolnik2008,lanza2009, saur2013,strugarek2015}.

Recently, AU Mic, an M0-M1~\citep{pecaut2013,gaidos2014} pre-main sequence dwarf star has been shown to be a promising candidate for magnetic SPI with its innermost planet~\citep{kavanagh2021}. AU Mic is a member of the $\beta$ Pic young moving group, which is $16-29$ Myr old~\citep{malo2014,binks2014,mamajek2014,bell2015,binks2016,shkolnik2017,miretroig2020}. %Based on its lithium abundance, AU Mic could be a few Myr older than the average group member~\citep{malo2014}. 
%Its rotation period of about $4.862$ d~\citep{plavchan2020, martioli2021} was determined from photometry obtained by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite~\citep[TESS,][]{ricker2014}.

AU Mic rotates at a $4.862$ d period; it shows strong solar-like differential rotation; possesses a strong, mostly poloidal large-scale magentic field of $>400$ G; and several activity indicators vary in phase with the star's latitude-dependent rotation periods~\citep{klein2021}. Optical light curves obtained by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite~\citep[TESS,][]{ricker2014} confirm previous observations~\citep{katsova1999, robinson2001, redfield2002} that AU Mic is actively flaring~\citep{martioli2021}.
%Spectral type tends to agree on M1, but effective temperature is lower in Plavchan et al. (2009)

AU Mic b is a Neptune-sized planet ($R_p = 4.3R_{Earth}$) that was first discovered using TESS photometry~\citep{plavchan2020} with an orbital period of $8.463$ d~\citep{plavchan2020,martioli2021}. %A magnetic interaction between star and planet can not only trigger flares, but also enhance X-ray activity and produce chromospheric hot spots~\citep{lanza2009}%, but the exact form and intesity of the interaction is difficult to assess even for individual stars~\citep{strugarek2019} 
\citet{kavanagh2021} predict magnetic SPI with AU Mic b to be observable in the radio regime, a signal indicative of a phenomenon similar to auroral flares observed in the Jupiter-Io system. Since AU Mic is the most actively flaring star among all currently known exoplanet hosts (Ilin et al. in prep.), we may expect SPI flares to also be triggered more readily by AU Mic b. 

In this work, we searched the TESS light curves of AU Mic for signs of flaring SPI. We present our light curve de-trending and flare finding method in Section \ref{sec:detrendfind}, and present the resulting flare catalog in Section \ref{sec:flarecatalog}. In Section \ref{sec:phases}, we show how we can combine flare samples from general time series measurements into a homogeneous data set, and apply this method to test whether flaring SPI signal is present in the TESS observations. We discuss our results and present our conclusions in Sections~\ref{sec:discussion} and \ref{sec:conclusions}.


\section{TESS photometry}
The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite~(TESS,~\citealt{ricker2014}) is an all-sky mission that began operations in 2018, and completed its first full sky scan in April 2020. It is still observing at the time of writing, collecting nearly continuous photometric times series in the 600-1000 nm band for $\sim 27$ d in each observing Sector. About $200\,000$ stars have been observed in 2-min cadence in the first two years of operations with about 20000 targets per Sector. Out of these, from Sector 27 on, 1000 targets were observed at even higher 20-s cadence.

AU Mic was observed in Sector 1 in 2 min cadence and in Sector 27 in 20 s cadence. The light curves reveal strong rotational variability from starspots, vigorous flaring and show transits of two planets, AU Mic b~\citep{plavchan2020,martioli2021} and AU Mic c~\citep{martioli2021}.

\section{Light curve de-trending and flare finding}
\label{sec:detrendfind}
Stellar light curves are time series of flux measurements that vary due to both astrophysical and instrumental effects. Flares are only one of many phenomena like spot variability, transits, eclipses, bursts and dips that can be detected in the data. Accurate automated flare detection algorithms are still challenging to design~\citep{vida2021}, not least due to this intrinsically heterogeneous morphology of light curves. We applied an iterative three-step algorithm to remove all but the variations caused by flares, and derive a realistic noise estimate (Section~\ref{sec:detrend}), then used a two-step $\sigma$-clipping procedure to mark flare candidates and derive their properties~(Section~\ref{sec:flarefind}), and present the resulting flare catalog in Section~\ref{sec:flarecatalog}.

\subsection{De-trending}
\label{sec:detrend}
The light curves were de-trended in three steps, each of which removed variability on decreasing time scales while preserving the flare signal. Typical flare times range from a few minutes to a few hours, and rarely exceed one day in duration. Most stellar variability occurs on longer time scales, except for ultrafast rotational variability in some stars~(Ilin+2021, submitted). The following method was designed with a broad spectrum of Kepler~\citep{borucki2010} and TESS light curve types in mind. Because AU Mic is extraordinarily active, we mark the adjustments made to accomodate that with comments in parentheses. 

First, we fit and subtract a third order spline function that goes through the start and end of any light curve portion that has no gaps longer than 2 h, and through an averaged flux point every 6 h (30 h for stars that are less variable than AU Mic) inbetween. This step removes long term trends as well as starspot variability on time scales of seveal days. If the light curve portion is shorter than 5 d, this step is skipped. 

Second, we iteratively remove strong periodic signal on time scales between 2 h and 5 d from the light curve. Each iteration first masks outlier points using a padded sigma-clipping procedure. For this step, single outliers above $3.5 \sigma$ are masked as pure outliers, and series of $n>1$ data points above $3.5 \sigma$ are masked as flare candidates or other extended outliers and padded with rounded $\sqrt{n}$ masked points before the outliers to capture slow rise phases, and rounded $2\sqrt{n}$ after the series to capture a potential extended decay phase that flares often display. Then we calculate a Lomb-Scargle periodogram for the light curve, and perform a least-square fit with a cosine function using the dominant frequency in the periodogram as a starting point. The cosine fit is then subtracted from the light curve. We iterate five times or until the dominant peak's signal-to-noise ratio drops below 1. 

As a third step, we again apply the padded outlier clipping, and smooth any remaining variability that is not sinusoidal, first with a 6 h and then with a 3 h window 3rd order Savitzky-Golay~\citep{savitzky1964} filter implemented in \texttt{scipy} as \texttt{signal.savgol\_filter}.

These three steps can sometimes overfit the very edges of the light curve, leaving small exponential drops or rises in the flux that affect the quiescent flux level calculation and/or produce false positive flare detections. If the first or the last data point is a $1\sigma$ outlier in the de-trended light curve, we fit an exponential growth or decay function to these fringes.

Finally we estimate the noise in the de-trended light curve using a rolling standard deviation with a 2 h window after padding outliers in the aforementioned way, but now above $1.5 \sigma$ ($2.5 \sigma$ for light curves with lower activity). We interpolated the masked outliers to arrive at a noise in the flare regions that is informed by the flux uncertainty in an adjacent light curve portion.

The result for the light curve in Sector 1 is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:illustrate_detrend}. The method was inspired by the iterative approach in~\citet{davenport2016} who searched the entire Kepler catalog for flares. We tested our approach on a variety of synthetic and real light curves in the TESS and Kepler archives, so that it can be applied directly to a larger sample.

\textcolor{red}{We provide an example script that shows how to use this method with Kepler and TESS short cadence light curve with \texttt{AltaiPony}.}

\subsection{Flare finding}
\label{sec:flarefind}
We searched the de-trended light curves for flare candidates. For this, we first find an iterative median, and then apply the threshold method introduced by~\citep{chang2015} that requires three consecutive positive outliers $3 \sigma$ above median for a candidate detection. To these data points we then add subsequent data points until one of them falls below a $2 \sigma$ above median threshold in order not to cut off detectable parts of the flare decay phase. This series of data points is then flagged as a flare candidate. For each flare, the pipeline returns the flare start and end points, duration, amplitude, and equivalent duration ($ED$) with uncertainties. The $ED$ is the integrated flare flux $F_{flare}$ divided by the median quiescent flux $F_0$ of the star, integrated over the flare duration~\citep{gershberg1972}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ED}
ED=\displaystyle \int \mathrm dt\, \frac{F_{flare}(t)}{F_0}.
\end{equation}

We tested our de-trending and flare-finding procedure on a range of both real and synthetic light curves that covers all typically observed variability signal patterns, and that contains flare signatures between ones that barely exceed the detection threshold to the largest flares we typically observe. We confirmed all flare candidates by eye, and manually corrected the flare duration in cases where the flare shape was not well captured by the algorithm by adding or subtracting data points to the detection. 

%Events like agrabrighetenings and fireflies that occur when light is reflected off of a passing particle into the detector can cause false positive detections that sometimes look similar to flares. These can be identified as occurring simultaneously in multiple light curves.

%False positives are called fireflies\footnote{\url{https://archive.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/mast/files/home/missions-and-data/active-missions/tess/_documents/TESS_Instrument_Handbook_v0.1.pdf}}, for instance in Sector 27.

%The pipeline produces many false positive events in light curves that are extracted from targets that heavily saturate the detector. In these, flares and astrophysical outbursts cannot be unambiguously distinguished from what is more likely a form of overdrive in the detectors' signal processing.

\end{figure}
We confirmed 75 flares in Sector 1, and 114 flares in Sector 27~(see bottom panels in Fig.~\ref{fig:illustrate_detrend} for examples). We found more flares in Sector 27 because its six times higher observing cadence lowers the detection threshold, which can be seen in the cumulative flare frequency distributions for both Sectors~(Fig.~\ref{fig:ffd}). Overall, we confirmed fewer flares than reported by \citet{martioli2021} who found the 162 and 157 flares in Sector 1 and 27, respectively. We attribute this difference to the respective detection methods. \citet{martioli2021} flagged single $2.5\sigma$ outliers as candidates, while we required three consecutive data points $3\sigma$ above the noise. Table \ref{tab:flares} lists the confirmed flare events with their respective start and finish times $t_s$ and $t_f$, orbital phase of AU Mic b at $t_s$, amplitude $a$ and $ED$.

\section{Flare rate variation with rotational and orbital phases}
\label{sec:phases}


\begin{figure*}

\end{figure*}

Stellar flares are thought to occur in the vicinity of active regions on the stellar surface, where magnetic field lines emerge, and magnetic energy can accumulate. AU Mic is a young, extremely active flaring star that is covered with large active regions~\citep{linsky1994, kochukhov2020, plavchan2020}, and possibly a multitude of magnetic loops across the entire corona~\citep{cranmer2013}\textcolor{red}{More on what we know about MF of AU Mic that pertains to its flaring here, and M dwarfs in general}. 

We expect to observe no preference with rotational phase of the star, because flares will randomly occur at the various active regions. If no interaction with the planets in AU Mic's orbit takes place that can trigger flares in certains regions on the star, we also do not expect to observe any dependence of flaring behaviour with orbital phase. We tested this hypothesis by deriving the expected flaring rate distribution under the assumption that no (rotational or orbital) dependence is present, and comparing it against the observed rate. The method works as follows:

We assume that we analyse $N$ light curves $S_k$ with $k\in [1,N]$ that cover observing periods that do not overlap, and each of which has the same flare detection threshold throughout the observing time of the light curve. However, our method allows that the treshold can vary from light curve to light curve, as is the case in our data set for AU Mic.
 
After having searched all $S_k$ for flares, we calculate the deviation from a uniform flare rate distribution with orbital and rotational phase using the Anderson-Darling test~\citep{anderson1952, stephens2006} in six steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Take all $F$ flare occurrence times from the data and derive their orbital or rotational phases $x_i$ with $i \in [1,F]$. 
\item Sort all $x_i$ by phase in ascending order.
\item Calculate observing time per phase using all valid data points in the de-trended light curves, taking into account the different observing cadences.
\item Sample $F$ flare occurrence phases from the phase coverage distribution to get a distribution of flare phases. This step generates a list of flares that are uniformly distributed across all orbital or rotational phases.
\item Repeat the previous step to obtain a large number of distributions, and calculate the AD statistic for each of them.  In this study, we generated 10 000 sample distributions for each test.
\item Finally, compare the AD statistic of the observed distribution of flare phases against the distribution of AD statistics from above, and calculate the significance level ($p$-value) of the difference. 
\end{enumerate}

Compare AD-test to KS-test results in Fig.~\ref{fig:kstest}.

The resulting $p$-values obtained from the above procedure are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:adtest}. One advantage of the Anderson-Darlin test over other flexible test like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is its sensitivity to the end of the distribution, i.e. phases near 0 or 1. Since for rotational and orbital phase the choice of phase 0 is arbitrary and the result should not depend on this choice we performed the A-D test at varying start phases with step size $0.1$. Except for a few outliers, the chosen phases lead to consisent results~(see the comparison with the K-S test in Section~\ref{sec:discussion}). However, these results demonstrate that neither the AD nor the KS test performed on a any single phase starting value give can difinitive answers.

Because AU Mic is seen nearly equator-on, the rotational phase diagrams are consistent with a uniform distribution of flares with stellar longitude (left panel in Fig.~\ref{fig:adtest}), as in the overwhelming majority of M dwarfs~\citep{doyle2018, doyle2019}. 

We split the rotational variability search by the two Sectors, because spot patterns were detected to be stabe over several rotation periods of the star~\citep{szabo2021changing}, but the changes in the shapes of the modulation that occurred in the two years between the two Sectors indicate that spot evolution is taking place on longer time scales~\citep{martioli2021new}.

The observed distribution of flares does not deviate from a uniform distribution of flares with orbital period either (right panel in Fig.~\ref{fig:kstests}).

Physical reasons for the absense of flaring SPI

\begin{itemize}
\item AU Mic b has no magnetic field that could interact with the stellar magnetic field to trigger flares~\citep{lanza2018close-by}. Planetary magnetic fields in the Solar System are diverse and depend heavily on the internal structure and composition of the planet~\citep{stevenson2003planetary}, and no direct measurements of exoplanet magnetic fields exist today. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the presence, or even the strength of the AU Mic b's field based solely on mass and radius estimates.
\item AU Mic b's orbit could be outside the Alfv\'en zone of AU Mic, either constantly or temporarily. Although the star has a stron magnetic field, a high mass loss rate may pull the Alfven surface closer to the star~\citep{kavanagh2021}. No energy can be channeled from the planet to the star. This may change due to stellar cycles, in which case we might observe flaring SPI in AU Mic 
\end{itemize}


Possible reasons not to observe flaring SPI despite its presence:

\begin{itemize}
\item The effect might be too subtle. SPI flares may be triggered rarely, with only a handful or fewer of flares in our sample, which are not detectable with sufficient significance. 
%The upper bound on the energies of flares that can arise from the interaction in a handful of sun-like planet hosts is predicted to be well above the detection limit of flares we found in the TESS light curve of AU Mic lanza2018. 
\item we are looking into the wrong flare energy regime. Flaring SPI may manifest at energies below $10^30$ erg, i.e. below the detection threshold. If the SPI flare regime lies at very high energies, they might again occur too rarely to be observed within the given monitoring time
\item Activity is evenly elevated through flaring SPI. Efficient transport of the transferred energy in the stellar magnetosphere evens out an interaction that occurs at preferred orbital phases, and can therefore not be distinguished from intrinsically elevated flaring. activity.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
Since SPI flares are morphologically identical to intrinsic stellar flares, a statistically significant orbital phase dependence of flaring behaviour is the closest we can currently get to detecting the effect directly. Using high cadence TESS observations of AU Mic, an early M dwarf with a close-in planet detected in 2020, we did not find any clear sign of flaring SPI.

The strength of the interaction is difficult to constrain in theory~\citep{strugarek2019}, and different physical models of flaring SPI co-exist~\citep{lanza2018, saur2013}. Moreover, the orbit of AU Mic b is not yet synchronized with the stellar rotation period which may lead to . Although AU Mic has the largest number of flares detected among all exoplanet hosts detected to date, we conclude that the vast majority of them are manifestations of intrinsic stellar activity. 

We do not rule out that, as time series observations of AU Mic accumulate with TESS, and soon PLATO, SPI-triggered flare can be detected. We argue further that long gaps on time scales of months to years betweeen consecutive light curves will help average out any confounding rotational variability signal, but should leave the SPI signal fully intact. The method we described is also insenstive to the effect of activity cycles, because these are caused by the stellar dynamo, and therefore elevate flaring activity in the entire star, usually without preference for specific longitudes or orbital phase. 

In an upcoming study, we will apply the methods of flare finding and orbital phase analysis presented here to a large sample of star-planet systems with known close-in planets to increase the total number of orbits covered, and to probe the effects of orbital distance and star-planet mass ratio on the presence and intensity of flaring SPI.
