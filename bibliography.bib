        obtained are evaluated by comparing simultaneous observations at
        different observatories. the statistical analysis of the UV Cet,
        YZ CMi, EV Lac and AD Leo flares observed in the B-band is
        carried out. The flare energy spectrum in the energy range where
        observational selection effects are small is found to be d lnv/d
        lnE $_{B}$=-1.4 to -1.9,v is an occurrence of flares with
        radiation energy ofE $_{B}$. The total flares' radiation is
        equal to 1.7\%, 1.2\%, 0.3\% and 0.4\% of the quiet radiation in
        the B-band of the stars listed, and the main part of this total
        radiation is due to the strongest flares. Distributions of flare
