        radiation energy ofE $_{B}$. The total flares' radiation is
        equal to 1.7\%, 1.2\%, 0.3\% and 0.4\% of the quiet radiation in
        the B-band of the stars listed, and the main part of this total
        radiation is due to the strongest flares. Distributions of flare

	abstract = {AU Mic is a young ({\textasciitilde}24 Myr), pre-main-sequence M dwarf star that was observed in the first month of science observations of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and reobserved 2 years later. This target has photometric variability from a variety of sources that is readily apparent in the TESS light curves; spots induce modulation in the light curve, flares are present throughout (manifesting as sharp rises with slow exponential decay phases), and transits of AU Mic b may be seen by eye as dips in the light curve. We present a combined analysis of both TESS Sector 1 and Sector 27 AU Mic light curves including the new 20 s cadence data from TESS Year 3. We compare flare rates between both observations and analyze the spot evolution, showing that the activity levels increase slightly from Sector 1 to Sector 27. Furthermore, the 20 s data collection allows us to detect more flares, smaller flares, and better resolve flare morphology in white light as compared to the 2 minute data collection mode. We also refine the parameters for AU Mic b by fitting three additional transits of AU Mic b from Sector 27 using a model that includes stellar activity. We show that the transits exhibit clear transit timing variations with an amplitude of {\textasciitilde}80 s. We also detect three transits of a 2.8 R ⊕ planet, AU Mic c, which has a period of 18.86 days.},

	abstract = {We carry out the first time-dependent numerical magnetohydrodynamic modeling of an extrasolar planetary system to study the interaction of the stellar magnetic field and wind with the planetary magnetosphere and outflow. We base our model on the parameters of the HD 189733 system, which harbors a close-in giant planet. Our simulation reveals a highly structured stellar corona characterized by sectors with different plasma properties. The star-planet interaction (SPI) varies in magnitude and complexity, depending on the planetary phase, planetary magnetic field strength, and the relative orientation of the stellar and planetary fields. It also reveals a long, comet-like tail which is a result of the wrapping of the planetary magnetospheric tail by its fast orbital motion. A reconnection event occurs at a specific orbital phase, causing mass loss from the planetary magnetosphere that can generate a hot spot on the stellar surface. The simulation also shows that the system has sufficient energy to produce hot spots observed in Ca II lines in giant planet hosting stars. However, the short duration of the reconnection event suggests that such SPI cannot be observed persistently.},

	abstract = {Evidence suggesting an observable magnetic interaction between a star and its hot Jupiter appears as a cyclic variation of stellar activity synchronized to the planet's orbit. In this study we monitored the chromospheric activity using several stellar activity indicators of seven stars with hot Jupiters using new high-resolution echelle spectra collected with ESPaDOnS over a few nights in 2005 and 2006 from the CFHT (Ca II H λ3968, K λ3933, the Ca II infrared triplet [IRT] λ8662 line, Hα λ6563, and He I λ5876). Synchronicity of the Ca II H and K emission of HD 179949 with its planet's orbit is clearly seen in four out of six epochs, while rotational modulation with Prot = 7 days is apparent in the other two seasons. We observe a similar phenomenon on υ And. This on/off nature of star-planet interaction (SPI) in the two systems is likely a function of the changing stellar magnetic field structure throughout its activity cycle. Variability in the transiting system HD 189733 is likely associated with an active region rotating with the star; however, the flaring in excess of the rotational modulation may be associated with its hot Jupiter. As for HD 179949, the peak variability as measured by the mean absolute deviation (MAD) for both HD 189733 and τ Boo leads the subplanetary longitude by {\textasciitilde}70°. The tentative correlation between this activity and the ratio of Mpsin i to the planet's rotation period, a quantity proportional to the hot Jupiter's magnetic moment, first presented by Shkolnik and coworkers remains viable. This work furthers the characterization of SPI, improving its potential as a probe of extrasolar planetary magnetic fields.

	abstract = {We have detected the synchronous enhancement of Ca II H and K emission with the short-period planetary orbit in HD 179949. High-resolution spectra taken on three observing runs extending over more than a year show the enhancement coincides with φ{\textasciitilde}0 (the sub-planetary point) of the 3.093 day orbit, with the effect persisting for more than 100 orbits. The synchronous enhancement is consistent with planet-induced chromospheric heating by magnetic rather than tidal interaction, but awaits confirmation by further observations. Independent observations are needed to determine whether the stellar rotation is synchronous with the planet's orbit. Of the five 51 Peg-type systems monitored, HD 179949 shows the greatest chromospheric H and K activity. Three others show significant nightly variations, but the lack of any phase coherence prevents us saying whether the activity is induced by the planet. Our two standards, τ Ceti and the Sun, show no such nightly variations. Revised periods and updated ephemerides for the planetary orbits are also included.},

	abstract = {Evidence of star-planet interactions in the form of planet-modulated chromospheric emission has been noted for a number of hot Jupiters. Magnetic star-planet interactions involve the release of energy stored in the stellar and planetary magnetic fields. These signals thus offer indirect detections of exoplanetary magnetic fields. Here, we report the derivation of the magnetic field strengths of four hot Jupiter systems, using the power observed in calcium uc(ii) K emission modulated by magnetic star-planet interactions. By approximating the fractional energy released in the calcium uc(ii) K line, we find that the surface magnetic field values for the hot Jupiters in our sample range from 20 G to 120 G, around 10-100 times larger than the values predicted by dynamo scaling laws for planets with rotation periods of around 2-4 days. However, these values are in agreement with scaling laws relating the magnetic field strength to the internal heat flux in giant planets. Large planetary magnetic field strengths may produce observable electron cyclotron maser radio emission by preventing the maser from being quenched by the planet's ionosphere. Intensive radio monitoring of hot Jupiter systems will help to confirm these field values and inform the generation mechanism of magnetic fields in this important class of exoplanets.},
